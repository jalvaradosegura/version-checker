# Welcome to version-checker

ðŸš§ Currently the documentation is the same as the main `README.md`, more details are on the making.

Here is a [tutorial](https://dev.to/jalvaradosegura/dont-forget-to-update-that-value-in-those-files-3i78) from scratch.

## Requirements

- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to set up the hook
- Python 3.7+

## Quickstart

Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file (like any other pre-commit hook):

```yaml
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/jalvaradosegura/version-checker
    rev: v0.5.0-alpha
    hooks:
      - id: version-checker
        args: [--files, CHANGELOG.md, Jenkinsfile, testing_hooks/__init__.py]
```

With this configuration we are saying: before each commit, check that the files defined after `--files`, contains the version indicated in the `pyproject.toml` file.

> You can make the hook look up for the version in another file. This is done by setting the `--grab-version-from` argument in the `.yaml` file.

### How it looks when running it

Following the previous example, let's say that I updated the version of a package I'm working on to `3.0.0` in the `pyproject.toml` file. Then I updated almost all references to that version on the different files, but I forgot to do it on the `CHANGELOG.md` file:

If we then update the `CHANGELOG.md` file accordingly, the hook will pass.

> Remember that you can always set the `stages` parameter in your `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, to make it run, for example, only before doing a push.
